# Router [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)

## What is this
This is an implementation of a Router in PHP 8, primarily inspired by the MVC pattern. This is by no means finished and probably couldn't be used in a larger scale application. However it is a nice PoC of how you can start building a Router.

## Usage
This project requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to be deployed. To do so, run
``docker-compose up`` and a container with NGINX and PHP 8 will be deployed.
